## Scripts for paper

Below we document what each script is doing

1. `MakeMcalMask.py`: This script makes the baseline masks for metacal so that later calculations can be faster. (perhaps this can be combined into the mastercat later)
2. `CalculateBasicStats.py` This script outputs, for both the total sample and per bin total number of galaxies, area, responses, neff and sigmae
